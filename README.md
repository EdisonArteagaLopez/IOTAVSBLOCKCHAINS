📘 IOTA vs Blockchain – Benchmark Suite (Simulated)

This project implements a complete reproducible benchmark suite to compare the performance of IOTA and Ethereum/Sepolia under a fully simulated environment, eliminating network noise and enabling rigorous statistical analysis.

It includes:
	•	Latency, throughput, and scalability tests
	•	Deterministic simulation using seeded RNG
	•	Replicated executions (N=30 by default)
	•	Automatic computation of:
	•	Mean
	•	Variance
	•	Standard deviation
	•	95% Confidence Intervals (Normal distribution)
	•	Automatic CSV export
	•	Full Python analysis with visualizations

⸻

🧪 1. Included Tests

1. Latency Test (Simulated)

Measures:
	•	Average latency
	•	p95 latency
	•	CPU time
	•	Success rate

For networks:
	•	Ethereum (Sepolia → simulated)
	•	IOTA (submitBlock → simulated)

⸻

2. Throughput Test (Simulated)

Sends a parallel batch of simulated transactions/blocks.

Collects:
	•	Throughput (TPS)
	•	Average latency
	•	Success rate

⸻

3. Scalability Test (Simulated)

Evaluates performance across multiple batch sizes:

10, 100, 1000, 10000

For each size:
	•	TPS
	•	Average latency
	•	Success rate

⸻

🔁 2. Replicated Executions (Monte Carlo)

The file run-simulated-benchmarks.js includes:
	•	withSeed(seed, fn)
	•	runReplicatedSuite(N)

This allows running each test N times, each with a fixed RNG seed, giving:
	•	Full reproducibility
	•	Noise reduction
	•	Statistically robust metrics

Statistics computed per metric

Using normal distribution, as requested:

CI95 = \bar{x} \pm 1.96 \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}

The system computes and exports:
	•	mean
	•	variance
	•	std
	•	ci95_lower
	•	ci95_upper
	•	n (number of replications)

▶️ 4. Running the Benchmarks

Run the standard benchmark suite:

node src/tests/run-simulated-benchmarks.js

Run only the replicated suite:

runReplicatedSuite(30)

Or from CLI (if CLI mode added):

node src/tests/run-simulated-benchmarks.js --replications 30


⸻

📊 5. Analysis & Visualization (Python)

Use the script:

analysis/analyze_benchmarks.py

Run:

python analyze_benchmarks.py

This generates:

Tables (in SUMMARY.md)
	•	Latency (mean + CI95)
	•	p95 Latency (CI95)
	•	Throughput (mean + CI95)
	•	Scalability metrics per batch size (CI95)
	•	Success rate CI95

📦 6. How to Interpret the Results

This suite allows you to answer:

✔ Which network is faster?
✔ Which network provides higher throughput?
✔ How do networks behave under increasing load?
✔ How stable are the results across seeds?
✔ Are the differences statistically significant?

Statistical interpretation:
	•	If CI95 intervals do NOT overlap →
Significant performance difference.
	•	If CI95 intervals overlap →
Differences may be due to simulation noise.

♻️ 7. Cleaning Up Results

It’s not required to delete previous logs/CSVs, since files have timestamps.

To wipe everything clean:

rm -rf results/* logs/*


⸻

🧱 8. Requirements
	•	Node.js ≥ 18
	•	Python ≥ 3.10

Python dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib

🛠 9. Recommended Next Enhancements

If you want, I can add:
	•	Full CLI flags (--replicas, --tag, --skip-tests)
	•	Outputs to Parquet or JSONL
	•	Auto-generated PDF report
	•	Jupyter-ready notebook
	•	Real-network benchmarking mode
